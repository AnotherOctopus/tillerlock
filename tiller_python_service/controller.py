Given the following review comment that was made as a suggestion to improve the codebase, please do your best to fix the codebase to adhere to the suggestions of the review comment. The comment is listed as such: \n{comment_body}\n and the change should be made in the file below, {line_number_prompt}: `\n{code_base}\n` Your response should only include the entirety of the original codebase with replacements for the recommended adjustments, and no other text, generated commentary, or unnecessary punctuation.

For example, a recommended change to functionality may entail a change to the function signature.
