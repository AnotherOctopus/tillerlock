The codebase looks good overall. One suggestion for improvement would be to include error handling for cases where the file being read or overwritten does not exist or cannot be accessed.

To implement this suggestion, I would modify the `read_file` and `overwrite_file` functions to include a try-except block that catches any `FileNotFoundError` or `PermissionError` exceptions. For example:

```python
def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r") as f:
            return f.read()
    except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError) as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        return ""

def overwrite_file(file_path, new_file_contents):
    try:
        with open(file_path, "w") as f:
            f.write(new_file_contents)
    except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError) as e:
        print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")
```

This ensures that any errors that occur while reading or writing to the file are handled gracefully, with an error message printed to the console and an empty string returned as the file contents in the case of a read error.
